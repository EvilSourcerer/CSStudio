    **We strongly recommend you download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because of it's powerful intellisense for javascript.**
    
    ## Requirements
    This program requires Node JS to compile. Please note this is not required in the final build, it is automatically integrated when compiled.
    To install Node, you must go to [Node.js's website](https://nodejs.org/en/), and install their SDK. Then restart your computer.
    Once you have rebooted, clone this repository and `cd` to the extracted repository in Command Prompt. To run the program, do `npm start`.
